Project proposal feedback
==================

**Team number**: 86<br>
**Team name**: cBay<br>
**Team members**: haodongl, weiqingy

### Bailey
This looks like a reasonable proposal. I think that to avoid ending up with
something too similar to Grumblr you should aim to meet most of your features.
It may be interesting to interface with the PayPal or Venmo APIs as a way of
managing payment.

### Arthur
Looks like you have a lot of features for this project. The scope is generally good, but you may want to look into selecting one or two of those features and moving it to a lower priority.
